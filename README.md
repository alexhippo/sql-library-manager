# SQL Library Manager

This project is an application built to manage books for a library.

Users can:
- view a list of books
  - includes pagination, where 10 books are listed per page
- add/create new books
- update existing books 
- search for books based on title, author, genre and published year
- delete books

The app follows the mockup designs in the mockups folder and the markup in the example-markup folder, with some slight tweaks for better accessibility.
